# CodeLathe Technical Test

A demo app showcasing my technical skills and understanding of the iOS platform. It's written entirely in SwiftUI and requires iOS 14 to run.

The first screen presents a list of breweries in Philadelphia (that's where I'm from), fetched from the [Open Brewery DB API](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/). The second screen in the Virtual CV layed out according to the design you specified in Figma. I also added a couple of unit and UI tests. There isn't much in this app to test, but I wanted to demonstrate my familiarity with testing iOS apps.

The project is ready to build as-is. No CocoaPods, no third party libraries of any kind üëç
